GTK # Gtk is the toolkit which is used to display windows and widgets on the screen. The widgets can be added directly in code or described through an xml file.
Supported widgets are for example: Windows, dialogs, labels, images, spinner, progressbars, several buttons and switches, textboxes, tables, lists, menus, toolbars, popovers, and much more.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://gircore.github.io/docs/windows.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gircore.github.io/docs/windows.html</guid><description>Building on Windows # Currently, Gtk must be obtained manually on windows. Hopefully this can be automated down the line.
MSYS2/GCC # The easiest way to get started on Windows is by installing gtk through msys2.
Download msys2 from the official website . Run pacman -Syu to update the package database. Run pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3 to install gtk3. Add the directory C:/msys64/mingw64/bin to your PATH. Then, follow the gir.core instructions as normal.</description></item></channel></rss>
